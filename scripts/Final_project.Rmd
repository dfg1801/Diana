Hi! Welcome to my final project page. Some background info: for birds, there is evidence of beak morphology being highly related to feeding ecology. The HI honeycreepers are an adaptive radiation with crazy variation in beak morphology, which leads people to believe that their 
But just looking at the birds' beaks and diets, it seems like many similar feeding ecologies still yield a lot of different beak shapes. I wanted to see if there is correlation between difference in beak morphology and phylogenetic distance, maybe hinting at the interaction between a species' lineage and their feeding ecology shaping their morphology. Are we able to predict species' morphological differences based on their phylogenetic difference? What does this pattern look like? 
My morphological data is taken from [AVONET](https://opentraits.org/datasets/avonet.html). The landmarks for the measurements are written in the data dictionary, but here is a figure from their paper which visually shows the measurement methods. Note number 1, 3, and 4 in particular.

# Setup

### Load Packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)
library(reshape2) # for working with matrices
library(phytools) # for working with phylo data
library(patchwork)
library(car)
library(ggResidpanel)
```

### Load data

I will use bird morphological measurements from AVONET, combined with my own general info about honeycreepers. In addition, I will use the most-resolved currently published honeycreeper phylogeny from [Lerner et al. 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2011.09.039), digitized by Dr. Matzke as part of [his paper](https://doi-org.eres.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/10.1093/sysbio/syu056), plotted below for your viewing pleasure :) 


```{r, tree}
data <- read_csv(here("data", "AVONET_Raw_Data.csv")) # avonet data
names <- read_csv(here("data", "Honeycreeper_info.csv")) # gathered honeycreeper info

tree_name <- file.path(here("data", "Lerner_etal_2011_CurrBio_honeycreepers_mod.newick"))
tree <- read.newick(tree_name)
plot(tree) # test that the tree read in correctly
```


# Cleaning

For this project, I will be using data from AVONET, an online database of bird data. In particular, I will be selecting out the HI honeycreepers within this dataset. There were many complications with this process because of multiple species having alternative scientific names as well as the phylogenetic data having a mix of the common or 'ōlelo names. Sigh. 

### Morphological data
```{r}
names_clean <- names %>%
  clean_names()
morpho <- data %>%
  select(Avibase.ID:Publication) %>% # for some reason imported with a bunch of extra empty cols? 
  clean_names() %>% # clean names lol 
  #there are species with alternate names, so I want to make sure that if they are named under this name they are still captured within the dataset
  mutate(across(species1_bird_life:species3_bird_tree, 
                ~ ifelse(. == "Hemignathus munroi", "Hemignathus wilsoni", .))) %>% #change alt sci names (munroi) into their primary names as listed in names_clean (wilsoni), . means if false keep value in cell currently
  mutate(across(species1_bird_life:species3_bird_tree, 
                ~ ifelse(. == "Hemignathus flavus", "Chlorodrepanis flava", .))) %>%
  mutate(across(species1_bird_life:species3_bird_tree, 
                ~ ifelse(. == "Hemignathus kauaiensis", "Chlorodrepanis stejnegeri", .))) %>%
  mutate(across(species1_bird_life:species3_bird_tree, 
                ~ ifelse(. == "Loxops coccineus coccineus", "Loxops coccineus", .))) %>%
  mutate(across(species1_bird_life:species3_bird_tree, 
                ~ ifelse(. == "Oreomystis mana", "Manucerthia mana", .))) %>%
  mutate(across(species1_bird_life:species3_bird_tree, 
                ~ ifelse(. == "Loxops mana", "Manucerthia mana", .))) %>%
  mutate(across(species1_bird_life:species3_bird_tree, 
                ~ ifelse(. == "Hemignathus virens", "Chlorodrepanis virens", .))) %>%
  filter(species1_bird_life != "Himatione fraithii") %>% # this one particular sp seems to be mis-named as Himatione sanguinea in the birdtree dataset but im not sure? so I will remove these rows instead
  rename("sci_name" = species1_bird_life) %>% # make col names match for join
  inner_join(names_clean, by = "sci_name") %>%
  select(avibase_id, sci_name, hi_name, common_name, diet, detailed_diet, source:age, beak_length_culmen:tail_length) %>%
  mutate(common_name = coalesce(common_name, hi_name)) %>% # coalesce (frm dplyr) is good for replacing NAs with values from other vectors. if there is a missing common name, use the name from the hi_name column
  mutate(common_name = str_replace_all(common_name, "`", "")) %>% # get rid of tone markings so it can match the names from the phylo 
  mutate(common_name = str_replace_all(common_name, "ō", "o")) %>%
  mutate(common_name = str_replace_all(common_name, "ā", "a"))
```

So after all of that, we can finally have a nice table with all of our honeycreeper info and specimens' measurements from AVONET. The dietary info is taken from the HI DLNR website. Note that measurements are in mm (or g for body mass) Here it is: 
```{r, cols.print = 5}
morpho
```

# Analysis/Results

My end goal for this analysis is to create scaled and normalilzed regressions of the pairwise phylogenetic and morphometric distances between each species in order to see if there is some relationship between the two which differs from the null. If I had more time, I would definetly add more statistical rigor but for now I am just trying to get things working. 

## Matrix making

But before comparing the pairwise  distances, we first have to generate them. First, I will average all the specimens within a species, then I will calculate pairwise distances. 

Luckily there is a function (stats::dist()) which does this. As well as (phytools::cophenetic.phylo()), which finds distances based on branch lengths from phylogenetic data. Once I make the matrices, then I melt them into a dataframe, with the important columns being the pair of names and the other being the distance between the pair. Whew! 

Note that the final data will have duplicates in the form of reciprocated pairs (eg. akohekohe, anianiau and anianiau, akohekohe). Probably best practice would be to cut these out but I'm not actually doing much in terms of statistical testing so it doesn't matter too much for me :P One thing I did do is to make sure to cut out pairwise distnaces between the same species as they are inherently going to be 0. I didn't want these 0s to skew the z-scoring and they are not informative data. 

### Morphometric Data

Again, so much cleaning so that the phylogenetic and morphometric data can match. Also, I really struggled to make the matrix keep the species names for some reason T_T

#### Beak Length
This measurement is specifically for beak length to the culmen (see fig. 1). There was also beak length to the nares, but I arbitrarily chose to do this one. 

```{r}
#first cut up the table a bit
beak_length <- morpho %>%
  mutate(common_name = str_replace_all(common_name, " ", "_")) %>%
  mutate(common_name = str_replace_all(common_name, "Lesser_Amakihi", "Anianiau")) %>% # the phylo used diff names for these T_T
  mutate(common_name = str_replace_all(common_name, "Hawaii_akepa", "Akepa")) %>%
  mutate(common_name = str_replace_all(common_name, "Crested_honeycreeper", "Akohekohe")) %>%
  filter(common_name != "Akepa") %>% # akepa has no data so remove it from the matrix
  select(common_name, beak_length_culmen) %>%
  group_by(common_name) %>%
  summarise(mean_length_culmen = mean(beak_length_culmen)) %>%
  mutate(mean_length_culmen = scale(mean_length_culmen)) # scale measurements before calculating distances

# now make the pairwise distances
length_matrix=dist(beak_length)
length_matrix=as.matrix(length_matrix, labels=TRUE)
colnames(length_matrix) <- rownames(length_matrix) <- beak_length[['common_name']] #this line makes sure that the matrix retains the names

cleaned_length_dist <- length_matrix %>%
  melt() %>%
  filter(Var1 != Var2) %>% # remove the comparisons btween the same sp (inherently will be 0), so they dont skew scaling
  mutate(Var1 = str_to_lower(Var1)) %>% # make everything lowercase to make the matching easier 
  mutate(Var2 = str_to_lower(Var2)) %>%
  rename(length_dist = value) %>%
  mutate(pair = paste(Var1, ",", Var2)) %>% # make 1 col w both pair names
  mutate(pair = str_replace_all(pair, " ", "")) # remove all white spaces
head(cleaned_length_dist) # to check that this all went smoothly
```
Amazing :) Now do the same thing with beak width and depth! 

#### Beak Width

```{r}
##### first cut up the table a bit
beak_width <- morpho %>%
  mutate(common_name = str_replace_all(common_name, " ", "_")) %>%
  mutate(common_name = str_replace_all(common_name, "Lesser_Amakihi", "Anianiau")) %>% # the phylo used diff names for these T_T
  mutate(common_name = str_replace_all(common_name, "Hawaii_akepa", "Akepa")) %>%
  mutate(common_name = str_replace_all(common_name, "Crested_honeycreeper", "Akohekohe")) %>%
  filter(common_name != "Akepa") %>% # akepa has no data so remove it from the matrix
  select(common_name, beak_width) %>%
  group_by(common_name) %>%
  summarise(mean_width = mean(beak_width)) %>%
  mutate(mean_width = scale(mean_width))

# now make the pairwise distances
width_matrix=dist(beak_width)
width_matrix=as.matrix(width_matrix, labels=TRUE)
colnames(width_matrix) <- rownames(width_matrix) <- beak_width[['common_name']] #this is the only line

cleaned_width_dist <- width_matrix %>%
  melt() %>%
  filter(Var1 != Var2) %>%
  mutate(Var1 = str_to_lower(Var1)) %>% # make everything lowercase to make the matching easier 
  mutate(Var2 = str_to_lower(Var2)) %>%
  rename(width_dist = value) %>%
  mutate(pair = paste(Var1, ",", Var2)) %>% # make 1 col w both pair names
  mutate(pair = str_replace_all(pair, " ", ""))
```

#### Beak Depth

```{r}
##### first cut up the table a bit
beak_depth <- morpho %>%
  mutate(common_name = str_replace_all(common_name, " ", "_")) %>%
  mutate(common_name = str_replace_all(common_name, "Lesser_Amakihi", "Anianiau")) %>% # the phylo used diff names for these T_T
  mutate(common_name = str_replace_all(common_name, "Hawaii_akepa", "Akepa")) %>%
  mutate(common_name = str_replace_all(common_name, "Crested_honeycreeper", "Akohekohe")) %>%
  filter(common_name != "Akepa") %>% # akepa has no data so remove it from the matrix,
  select(common_name, beak_depth) %>%
  group_by(common_name) %>%
  summarise(mean_depth = mean(beak_depth)) %>%
  mutate(mean_depth = scale(mean_depth))

# now make the pairwise distances
depth_matrix=dist(beak_depth)
depth_matrix=as.matrix(depth_matrix, labels=TRUE)
colnames(depth_matrix) <- rownames(depth_matrix) <- beak_depth[['common_name']] #this is the only line

cleaned_depth_dist <- depth_matrix %>%
  melt() %>%
  filter(Var1 != Var2) %>%
  mutate(Var1 = str_to_lower(Var1)) %>% # make everything lowercase to make the matching easier 
  mutate(Var2 = str_to_lower(Var2)) %>%
  rename(depth_dist = value) %>%
  mutate(pair = paste(Var1, ",", Var2)) %>% # make 1 col w both pair names
  mutate(pair = str_replace_all(pair, " ", ""))
```


### Phylogenetic data

Now to generate the pairwise phylogenetic distances :)
```{r}
phylo_dist <- cophenetic.phylo(tree) # make pairwise matrix of phylogenetic distances

cleaned_phylo_dist <- phylo_dist %>%
  melt() %>% #turn matrix into a dataframe
  filter(Var1 != Var2) %>%
  filter(Var1 != "Akepa") %>% # no morpho data for Akepa/Hawaii Akepa, remove
  filter(Var2 != "Akepa") %>%
  filter(Var1 != "Maui_Amakihi") %>% # no morpho data for maui amakihi, remove
  filter(Var2 != "Maui_Amakihi") %>%
  mutate(Var1 = str_to_lower(Var1)) %>% # make everything lowercase to make the matching easier 
  mutate(Var2 = str_to_lower(Var2)) %>%
  rename(phylo_dist = value) %>%
  mutate(pair = paste(Var1, ",", Var2)) %>% # make 1 col w both pair names
  mutate(pair = str_replace_all(pair, " ", ""))

```


#### Joining phylo data to morpho data
```{r}
# length
scaled_length_dist <- cleaned_length_dist %>%
  left_join(cleaned_phylo_dist, by = join_by(pair)) %>%
  mutate(A_standard = pmin(Var1.x, Var2.x), B_standard = pmax(Var1.x, Var2.x)) %>% # create temp columns for sorting purposes, with A always having the name that is first alphabetically
  distinct(A_standard, B_standard, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% # only keep columns with distinct columns of A and B, which should both be sorted/factored so that dupes have the same A and B col 
  select(pair, length_dist, phylo_dist)

# width
scaled_width_dist <- cleaned_width_dist %>%
  left_join(cleaned_phylo_dist, by = join_by(pair)) %>%
  mutate(A_standard = pmin(Var1.x, Var2.x), B_standard = pmax(Var1.x, Var2.x)) %>% # create temp columns for sorting purposes, with A always having the name that is first alphabetically
  distinct(A_standard, B_standard, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  select(pair, width_dist, phylo_dist) 

# depth
scaled_depth_dist <- cleaned_depth_dist %>%
  left_join(cleaned_phylo_dist, by = join_by(pair)) %>%
  mutate(A_standard = pmin(Var1.x, Var2.x), B_standard = pmax(Var1.x, Var2.x)) %>% # create temp columns for sorting purposes, with A always having the name that is first alphabetically
  distinct(A_standard, B_standard, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  select(pair, depth_dist, phylo_dist)

```


#### All morpho

This is not the right way to do this but just for now: let's make a version of these distance dataframes that averages all the morphology in one :)
```{r}
scaled_morpho_dist <- cleaned_length_dist %>%
  left_join(cleaned_width_dist, by = join_by(pair)) %>%
  left_join(cleaned_depth_dist, by = join_by(pair)) %>%
  left_join(cleaned_phylo_dist, by = join_by(pair)) %>%
  mutate(A_standard = pmin(Var1.x, Var2.x), B_standard = pmax(Var1.x, Var2.x)) %>% # create temp columns for sorting purposes, with A always having the name that is first alphabetically
  distinct(A_standard, B_standard, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  select(pair, length_dist, depth_dist, width_dist, phylo_dist) %>%
  mutate(avg_morpho_dist = rowMeans(select(.,ends_with("h_dist")))) %>%
  select(pair, avg_morpho_dist, phylo_dist)

```


## Modeling + Plotting

Matching the phylo and morpho datasets was quite frustrating, not only did the phylogeny use an inconsistent mix of common and 'ōlelo names, the capitalization was inconsistent and not all species were represented in both datasets. Leading to one of my biggest time sinks, figuring out why all the pairwise distance dataframes were different lengths. T_T  

But now that we cleaned that up so diligently above, lets move on to plotting! In addition, let's see how a basic linear model fits the data for funsies lol

### Beak length

```{r, beak_length}
ggplot(scaled_length_dist, aes(x = phylo_dist, y = length_dist)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +
  labs(title = "Pairwise distances",
       subtitle = "Beak length difference vs phylogenetic distance",
       caption = "all data transformed via z-score normalization", 
       x = "Phylogenetic distance", 
       y = "Morphological distance"
       ) + 
  theme_bw()
```

#### Model making
```{r}
length_mod <- lm(length_dist~phylo_dist, data = scaled_length_dist)
Anova(length_mod)
resid_panel(length_mod, plots = c("resid", "qq", "lev", "hist"))
```

This one really doesn't have any correlation with phylo dist ^^' 

### Beak width
```{r, beak_width}
ggplot(scaled_width_dist, aes(x = phylo_dist, y = width_dist)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "Pairwise distances",
       subtitle = "Beak width difference vs phylogenetic distance", 
       caption = "all data transformed via z-score normalization", 
       x = "Phylogenetic distance", 
       y = "Morphological distance"
       ) + 
  theme_bw()
```

#### Model making
```{r}
width_mod <- lm(width_dist~phylo_dist, data = scaled_width_dist)
Anova(width_mod)
resid_panel(width_mod, plots = c("resid", "qq", "lev", "hist"))
```

Woah, phylo dist does have a pretty strong positive relationship with beak width! 

### Beak depth
```{r, beak_depth}
ggplot(scaled_depth_dist, aes(x = phylo_dist, y = depth_dist)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +
  labs(title = "Pairwise distances",
       subtitle = "Beak depth difference vs phylogenetic distance",
       caption = "all data transformed via z-score normalization", 
       x = "Phylogenetic distance", 
       y = "Morphological distance"
       ) + 
  theme_bw()
```

#### Model making
```{r}
depth_mod <- lm(depth_dist~phylo_dist, data = scaled_depth_dist)
Anova(depth_mod)
resid_panel(depth_mod, plots = c("resid", "qq", "lev", "hist"))
```


The phylo dist of 6 has a wierd gap, this seems to be because the maui parrotbill, compared to all the sp ~6 phylo dist away (amakihis), has high morphological beak depth dist. Meanwhile, these sp compared to it's sister, the akipolaau has lower morpho dist to everyone. Makes sense considering the high beak depth of the maui parrotbill's compared to all the amakihis.

### Average of morpho
```{r, avg_morpho}
ggplot(scaled_morpho_dist, aes(x = phylo_dist, y = avg_morpho_dist)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "Pairwise distances",
       subtitle = "Averaged beak length, depth, and width difference vs phylogenetic distance",
       caption = "all data transformed via z-score normalization", 
       x = "Phylogenetic distance", 
       y = "Average morphological distance"
       ) + 
  theme_bw()

sig <- sd(scaled_morpho_dist$avg_morpho_dist) # saving standard deviation of this plot
```

### Model making
I will make a model to see which measurement (if any) has the best explanatory power for 
```{r}
avg_mod <- lm(avg_morpho_dist~phylo_dist, data = scaled_morpho_dist)
Anova(avg_mod)
resid_panel(avg_mod, plots = c("resid", "qq", "lev", "hist"))
```

## Discussion

### Null model of trait evolution

Conveniently, there is an R function to do this within phytools :0
I am just simulating one trait - the average morpho 

```{r}
# simulate Brownian evolution on tree, just do avg of all morpho diff--------
x <- fastBM(tree, sig2 = sig^2, internal = TRUE) # sig from mean morpho above
phenogram(tree, x, spread.labels = TRUE, spread.cost = c(1, 0)) # visualize Brownian evolution on a tree, spread cost just makes sure labels don't overlap

#store data in df, clean up a bit----------
morpho_sim <- data.frame(x)
  
morpho_sim <- morpho_sim %>%
  mutate(species = rownames(morpho_sim)) %>%
  filter(!str_detect(species, "[0-9]")) %>% # only select rows of tip sp
  mutate(species = str_to_lower(species))

# now make the pairwise distances----------
sim_matrix=dist(morpho_sim)
sim_matrix=as.matrix(sim_matrix, labels=TRUE)


cleaned_sim_dist <- sim_matrix %>%
  melt() %>%
  filter(Var1 != Var2) %>%
  mutate(Var1 = str_to_lower(Var1)) %>% # make everything lowercase to make the matching easier 
  mutate(Var2 = str_to_lower(Var2)) %>%
  rename(sim_dist = value) %>%
  mutate(pair = paste(Var1, ",", Var2)) %>% # make 1 col w both pair names
  mutate(pair = str_replace_all(pair, " ", ""))

# other phylo dist had some stuff removed to match the avonet data so remake -------
phylo_dist <- cophenetic.phylo(tree) # make pairwise matrix of phylogenetic distances

cleaned_phylo_dist_full <- phylo_dist %>%
  melt() %>% #turn matrix into a dataframe
  filter(Var1 != Var2) %>%
  mutate(Var1 = str_to_lower(Var1)) %>% # make everything lowercase to make the matching easier 
  mutate(Var2 = str_to_lower(Var2)) %>%
  rename(phylo_dist = value) %>%
  mutate(pair = paste(Var1, ",", Var2)) %>% # make 1 col w both pair names
  mutate(pair = str_replace_all(pair, " ", ""))

#now put the two together ----------
scaled_sim_dist <- cleaned_sim_dist %>%
  left_join(cleaned_phylo_dist_full, by = join_by(pair)) %>%
  mutate(A_standard = pmin(Var1.x, Var2.x), B_standard = pmax(Var1.x, Var2.x)) %>% # create temp columns for sorting purposes, with A always having the name that is first alphabetically
  distinct(A_standard, B_standard, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  select(pair, sim_dist, phylo_dist)
```

#### Model making
```{r}
sim_mod <- lm(sim_dist~phylo_dist, data = scaled_sim_dist)
Anova(sim_mod)
resid_panel(sim_mod, plots = c("resid", "qq", "lev", "hist"))
```

As expected, the basic linear model fits this simulated data well and shows significant effect of phylo dist on morpho dist. Also, the residual panels show good fit. 

#### Plotting

Whew, ok now time to plot this data! 

```{r, brownian_dist}
ggplot(scaled_sim_dist, aes(x = phylo_dist, y = sim_dist)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +
  labs(title = "Pairwise distances",
       subtitle = "Simulated morphological distance vs phylogenetic distance",
       caption = "all data transformed via z-score normalization", 
       x = "Phylogenetic distance", 
       y = "Average morphological distance"
       ) + 
  theme_bw()
```

**Code for sim found in this [phytools exercise](http://phytools.org/eqg/Exercise_4.1/)**

This null model is based on Brownian motion, a common null model for trait evolution:  
z(t)∼N(z(0),σ^2^t)  
where z is a trait value at time (t). N indicates it will follow a normal distribution, and σ^2^ is variance. 

In a perfect world, my data would be more evely distributed along the whole range of phylogenetic distances and therefore the confidence intervals displayed would follow a pattern of being smaller at lower phylo dist, and wider at higher dist. 
<!-- Simply put, this model says assumes no evolutionary direction. It assumes that pairwise morphological distance will increase in variance as pairwise phylogenetic distance increases, following a normal distribution. The mean morphological distance at any point in time will remain 0. I will calculate the variance from the data. '  -->

If speciation happens most when species find new, unoccupied niche space and then adapt to it (ecological release), it would show up on my above graphs as a generically negative correlation, with smaller phylogenetic distance yielding high morphological distance, and higher phylogenetic distance yielding possibly lower morphological distance (with greater variance).  

The real-life data definetly has a tighter spread compared to the BM-modeled data, and generally seems to have a shallower slope. 

The results are muddled, with seemingly little effect of phylogenetic distance on morphological distance, positive or negative. The null model shows a significant effect of phylo dist on morpho dist, as well as beak depth. Idk ^^'

In terms of improving my current results, I have two ideas:  

1. I think I just need more resolution. So more data points. Adding species (especially extinct ones) to the phylogeny and morphology datasets would probably help tremendously.  
2. Phylogenetic distance did show ability as a predictor for beak width, indicating that maybe certain beak dimensions do just follow basic brownian motion, while others are affected by ecological effects. To me, this indicates necessity to be able to capture more dimensions of beak variation (not just length, width, and depth) such as curvature, symmetry of upper and lower mandible, etc.
